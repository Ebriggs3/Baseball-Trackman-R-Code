#Pitcher Performance Dashboard 
	An Interactive Shiny App to Visualize Pitcher Data After a Private Outing 
During the college season, most Division 1 teams have access to online resources such as Synergy Sports and 643 Charts. TrackMan CSV files from each regular-season game are uploaded to these platforms, allowing coaches to view various tables and visualizations for their players. However, during the Fall season, intersquad outings tracked by TrackMan are not uploaded to these sites. That’s where this Shiny app becomes invaluable. It enables you to upload any TrackMan file directly from your computer and filter through each pitcher to generate an individual summary table, a pitch movement plot, release point plot, strike zone plot, and whiff chart — all grouped by their pitch type.
